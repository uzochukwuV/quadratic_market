"""
Sports data client using The-Odds-API (https://the-odds-api.com).

Free tier: 500 requests/month. The bot uses two endpoints:
  - /sports/{sport}/odds  — upcoming fixtures with odds (to create markets)
  - /sports/{sport}/scores — completed scores (to settle markets)

Supports multiple market types per fixture:
  - h2h: 3-way (Home/Draw/Away) for soccer
  - btts: Both Teams To Score (Yes/No)
  - totals: Over/Under goals

Odds are converted to LMSR q_values for market seeding.
